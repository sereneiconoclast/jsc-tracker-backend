The DynamoDB database exists, in region us-west-2, and has this ARN: arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:373705399158:table/JSC-Tracker

This document describes the database schema. Note the following terms used in this schema:

* The 'emailsha1' is the 40-character, lowercased, hexadecimal SHA1 of the email address.
* All fields are strings, or arrays of strings, unless otherwise specified.
* All timestamps are expressed as seconds since the epoch (January 1, 1970) as a digit string.
* All entries have a timestamp field 'created_at' which is given a value when the row is added, and then never changed.
* All entries have a timestamp field 'modified_at' which is given a value when the row is added, and updated on all subsequent edits to that row.
* All entries have a timestamp field 'deactivated_at' which is given the value "0" when the row is added, and may be set to a timestamp if the row is to be "deleted". Rows are never actually deleted; they are just deactivated which hides them from queries. Certain queries may expressly state that deactivated rows should be returned so they may be reactivated.
* The JSC number <jsc-number> is a digit string that does not start with a zero, such as "3210".
* The special JSC number "0" is reserved to indicate who is a superuser.
* The JSC number "-1" indicates the user is not a member of any JSC right now.
* Contacts are stored per-user and are given an ID starting with "c" followed by four digits, such as "c0000".
* Fields described as <markdown string> contain Markdown, are edited as a multiline textarea field, and are rendered as the HTML translation of the Markdown when not being edited. Embedded links are supported.
